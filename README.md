# Back-end for Front-end (BFF)

## Introduction

BFF stands for Back-end for Front-end, an architectural pattern used in web application development. It is a backend component that provides data to the frontends of an application.

## Benefits

The BFF allows client applications to receive customized and optimized data according to their needs. This results in a better user experience, greater performance, efficiency, and scalability.

## Functionality

The BFF functions as an intermediary layer between the frontends and backends of an application. It allows teams to iterate on features more quickly and have control over the backend.
